# email-bomber
A basic email spammer/bomber made in Python.

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

You MUST enable less secure apps in the Google account settings or the app will not work, because it uses insecure authentication!

Maybe I will rewrite the code to support better auth somewhen in the future?
Only Gmail accounts are supported. I am not sure if emails from other providers work, I didn't test it.



Supports:
✅ Multiple email subjects

✅ Multiple email messages

✅ Random number generator to prevent message stacking.




Will support:
- Completely random subjects and messages
- more SMTPs (only Gmail is supported at the moment)
